<%= circled_title(3, "Change properties") %>

<p>Every release can specify a set of properties that need to be set in deployment manifest and provided to service. For example, that can be database credentials, address of another service, etc.</p>

<p>Our release allows to change property <b>port</b> on which server is listening. You can see the list of properties that can be modified in <b>learn-bosh-release/jobs/app/spec</b>. Let's open <b>manifest.yml</b> and under the section <b>properties</b> set the value of <b>port</b> to <b>8888</b>. Now we can just re-deploy our manifest changes. Note, we don't need to build new release version, configuration files will be regenerated with new properties.</p>

<p>Let's see that our property was changed:</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ curl 1.2.3.4:8888</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">Hello, you from ...</h4>
</div>
