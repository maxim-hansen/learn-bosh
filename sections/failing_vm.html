<%= circled_title(2, "Failing VM") %>

<p>What if there is a problem with instance that is running our service? BOSH offers manual and automatic recovery when there are problems with infrastructure resources like VMs or disks. In this exercise we are going to kill one of our instances and use manual recovery option.</p>

<p>Lets destroy one of our instances.</p>

<p>Get the VM CID ("Cloud ID") for the instance we want to destroy.</p>
<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -e playground -d learn-bosh vms</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">Deployment 'learn-bosh'

Instance    Process State  AZ       IPs      VM CID
app/guid-1  running        vsphere  1.2.3.4  vm-guid
app/guid-2  running        vsphere  1.2.3.5  vm-guid
  </h4>
</div>

<p>Log into the vSphere Client UI, search for the VM CID. Once you've found the VM for the instance you want to destroy, force stop it and delete it from disk.</p>

<p>Let's see that one of the instances is in a bad state:</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -e playground instances</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">...
Instance    Process State       IPs
app/guid-1  running             1.2.3.4
app/guid-2  unresponsive agent  1.2.3.5
...</h4>
</div>

<p>One of the components in BOSH is the Health Monitor. It independently watches system health and will bring missing instances back up by instructing infrastructure to recreate missing resources like VMs with the required persistent disk. Keep running <b>bosh -e playground instances</b> and see that instance is brought up and service is running eventually.</p>

<p>Now let's turn off automatic repair and manually resolve the issue.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -e playground update-resurrection off</h4>
</div>

<p>Destroy one of the VMs again as described above. Run cloud check and select option "Recreate VM and wait for processes to start".</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -e playground -d learn-bosh cloud-check</h4>
</div>

<p>Cloud check command allows to manually resolve issues when resources (VMs and persistent disks) are in a bad state. Run <b>bosh -e playground instances</b> to see all instances running again.</p>
